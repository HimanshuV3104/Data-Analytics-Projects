LendingGuard: Loan Default & Financial Risk Analytics Dashboard
Project Description
This project is a comprehensive Data Analytics Dashboard focused on credit risk assessment and loan portfolio performance. By analyzing historical data from 2013 to 2018, the project identifies key patterns between borrower demographics, employment stability, and default probabilities.

The analysis provides actionable insights for financial institutions to optimize their lending strategies, mitigate "High Risk" profiles, and understand the correlation between credit scores and loan repayment behavior.

Core Analytical Features:

Risk Segmentation by Employment: Identifies that Unemployed individuals carry the highest default rate at 3.39%, followed by Part-time workers at 3.01%.

Loan Portfolio Overview: Analyzes loan distribution by purpose, showing Home Loans as the largest category at 6545M.

Credit Score Impact: Evaluates how credit categories affect loan volume, revealing that Medium Credit holders account for the highest total loan amount at 4.6bn.

Demographic Profiling: Breaks down the average loan amount by age groups (Adults, Seniors, Teens) and marital status to understand borrower behavior.

Financial Risk Metrics: Tracks Year-Over-Year (YOY) changes, highlighting a significant 1.9% increase in default loans in 2018.

Income Bracket Analysis: Visualizes the flow of capital, showing that High Income earners dominate the portfolio with a total loan sum of 21.73bn.

Tech Stack Suggested:

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau (as seen in the dashboard layout).

Analysis: Tracking YOY growth and percentage-based risk distribution.

Data Modeling: Financial segmentation based on Credit Bins and Income Brackets.
